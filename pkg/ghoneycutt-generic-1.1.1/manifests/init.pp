    #   $shell      - user's shell, defaults to "/bin/bash"
    #   $home       - home directory, defaults to /home/<username>
    #   $ensure     - present by default
    #   $managehome - true by default
    #   $dotssh     - creates ~/.ssh by default
    #   $comment    - comment field for passwdany additional groups the user should be associated with
    #   $groups     - any additional groups the user should be associated with
    #   $password   - defaults to "!!"
    #   $symlink    - use a symlink for the home directory
